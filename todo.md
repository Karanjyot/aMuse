Things we can do today and tomorrow
The best would be to fix up current issues and add small components to make our lives easier

Novel Items
- Modal Component
- SlideDrawer Component for the menu selection
- Backdrop for both the modal and drawer presentation
- MusicPlayer Component that can be used to play mp3 files

Fixing Up Current Items
- Create a nicer Header Component with a menu button that can create a dropdown. 
- Control the use of anchor tags and change it to using handlers referenced by the onClick method
- Create the general layout for the homepage so that we know how to style information that will be retrieved from the database in the future
  as the styling and classes can be reused

If time permits
- There are problems with having two identical pages for both login and sign-up. These can be merged into one
  - the problem comes from having identical styling. Since the names are the same, if one gets changed it can effect classes of another as the   css is global regardles of how its imported to the component
